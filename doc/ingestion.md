# Ingestion

How data flows from FMP into the warehouse, and the guarantees that make it
research-grade.

## Principles

- **Land raw, then transform.** Every response is persisted to `landing.fmp_raw`
  (payload + hash) before transformation, so the original is always recoverable.
- **Validate at the boundary.** Each row is typed and sanity-checked (cross-field,
  ranges, nulls). Failures are **quarantined** into `ops.data_quality_flag`, never
  silently dropped.
- **Idempotent.** Loads upsert on the natural key (`ON CONFLICT ... DO UPDATE`).
  Re-pulling a window converges to the same state.
- **Incremental & resumable.** Per-symbol watermarks (`ops.load_watermark`) bound
  each pull to the new tail, with a configurable overlap (`overlap_days`, default 5)
  to absorb late corrections. A load that dies mid-universe resumes from its
  watermarks, not from scratch.
- **Lineage.** Every load opens an `ops.ingestion_run` row (params, window, counts,
  bytes, status).

## Respecting FMP limits (Professional plan)

The source client (`fafnir/sources/fmp.py`) throttles **proactively** to
`request_rate_per_min` (default 280, under the ~300/min ceiling), backs off with
exponential delay + jitter on HTTP 429 and 5xx, retries transient failures, and
**meters bytes** so bandwidth can be tracked against the 50 GB/month budget
(`ops.ingestion_run.bytes_downloaded`). Prefer comma-separated batch pulls where
an endpoint supports them.

## Endpoint → table map

All endpoints are on the `stable/` base, matching what is already proven against
the Professional plan in the original `duk`.

| Loader | FMP endpoint | Target table(s) | Natural key |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ingest securities` | `stock-list`, `etf-list` | `core.security`, `core.symbol_xref` | (source, primary_symbol, exchange) |
| `ingest securities --enrich` | `profile` | `core.security`, `core.company_profile` | security_id |
| `ingest prices` | `historical-price-eod/full` | `core.daily_price` | (security_id, trade_date) |
| `ingest actions` | `splits`, `dividends` | `core.corporate_action` | (security_id, action_type, ex_date) |
| `adjust` | (derived) | `core.adjustment_factor` | (security_id, effective_date) |

> **Verify before the first production backfill:** the `splits` / `dividends`
> stable field names (`numerator`/`denominator`, `dividend`/`adjDividend`) should
> be confirmed against a live response for a known symbol (e.g. AAPL). The loader
> already tolerates the common alternates; the endpoint paths are centralized as
> constants in `FMPClient` for a one-line correction.

## The adjustment step

`fafnir adjust` recomputes `core.adjustment_factor` from `core.corporate_action`:

- split num:den → price × (den/num), volume × (num/den) for prior dates;
- cash dividend D vs prior close P → price × ((P−D)/P) for prior dates.

Cumulative factors are built from latest ex-date backwards. The adjusted view picks,
for each `trade_date`, the factor at the smallest `effective_date` greater than that
date — i.e. the product of every action that happened after it. Prices on/after the
latest ex-date get factor 1.0. This is why adjusted prices are **point-in-time
stable**: they are a deterministic function of the actions known as of a date, not a
frozen snapshot. See [adr/0001](adr/0001-raw-prices-plus-adjustment-factors.md).

## Order of operations (daily)

```
ensure-partitions → prices → actions → adjust → refresh-marts → dq run
```

Prices precede actions so dividend adjustment can value against fresh closes.
`scripts/daily_update.sh` encodes this order.
